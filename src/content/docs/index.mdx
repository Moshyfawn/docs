## Next steps

	<Card title="Stay in flow" icon="laptop">
		Productive coding starts with a tool that stays out of your way. Zed combines the power of an IDE with the responsiveness of a lightweight editor for productivity you can feel under your fingertips.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Connect with your team" icon="gitter">
		With Zed, multiple developers can navigate and edit within a shared workspace. This makes it easy to have nuanced, real-time conversations about any part of your codebase, whether the code in question was committed last year or hasn't yet been saved to disk.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Beauty from within" icon="rocket">
		Great products begin with great engineering. We care hard about implementation details you don't see to produce an editor you will forget you are using.
